;Write an assembly program that reads in integers and adds them together; 
;until zero is read in. Then it outputs the sum. 

START:  READ        ; read input
        
        JMPZ DONE   ; if n = 0 then jump to DONE
        
        ADD SUM     
        
        STA SUM 

        JUMP START   ; jump to start to read again


DONE:   LDA SUM     ; load final sum
        
        WRITE

        STOP 

SUM: .data 2 0
